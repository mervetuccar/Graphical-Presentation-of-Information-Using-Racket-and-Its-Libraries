##Favorite Lines of Code

####Alex
The below code is the main method used throught the slideshow for laying out and wrapping text. This code is demonstrated in slide 2, and though it doesnt look incredibly impressive, I felt pretty successful after figuring out how to overlay images and text in a clean, legible way.

    (lt-superimpose 
        (hc-append
                  (para #:align 'left #:fill? #t #:width 470 "         ")
                  (bitmap  "cyberdyne_behind_the_scenes.jpg")) 
      (vl-append (item #:bullet (bitmap (arrowhead 20 0)) "Artificial Intelligence") 
                  (vl-append 
                             (vl-append (item #:bullet (bitmap (arrowhead 20 0)) "Neural Network Processes")
                                        (item #:bullet (bitmap (arrowhead 20 0)) #:width 470 "Advanced Robotics for Medicine"))
                             (vl-append (item #:bullet (bitmap (arrowhead 20 0)) "Consumer Products")
                                        (item  #:bullet (bitmap (arrowhead 20 0)) "Defense"))))))

##Additional Remarks
* Song curently does not stop after slideshow ends. The only way to kill it is to close Dr.Racket. Comment out (play-sound) line if you dont want to deal with it. Working on a fix.
* Images in repo must be in same folder as code to work. Backup copy of images canbe download from dropbox link below-- just move code to the iamge folder before running.
* Slides are timed to change after twenty seconds. If you attempt to manually navigate the slideshow, slides will appear out of order.
